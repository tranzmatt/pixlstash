"""Find (and optionally remove) files under the vault image root that have no
corresponding row in the database.

This is the disk→DB direction. The complementary ``MissingFilePurgeTask``
handles DB→disk (picture rows whose file is gone). Orphaned files typically
accumulate from:

  * restoring an older snapshot - pictures imported *after* that snapshot keep
    their files on disk but lose their DB row;
  * crashes between writing a file and committing its row;
  * manual edits to the image folder.

What counts as "not orphaned" (kept):
  * every managed picture file (``Picture.file_path`` joined to image_root);
  * its pre-#1164 sibling thumbnail ``{stem}_thumb.webp``;
  * its sidecar caption ``{stem}.txt`` / ``{stem}.caption``;
  * system content under image_root: ``vault.db`` (+ ``-wal``/``-shm``/
    ``-journal``), and the ``snapshots/``, ``.pixlstash-thumbnails/``,
    ``.ref_thumbs/``, ``tmp/`` and ``.orphan_trash/`` directories.

Reference-folder pictures have absolute ``file_path`` (outside image_root), so
they are never scanned.

Usage:
    python scripts/find_orphaned_files.py <image_root>               # report only
    python scripts/find_orphaned_files.py <image_root> --delete      # move to .orphan_trash/
    python scripts/find_orphaned_files.py <image_root> --hard-delete # permanently remove

Examples:
    python scripts/find_orphaned_files.py ~/.config/pixlstash/images
    python scripts/find_orphaned_files.py /vault --delete
