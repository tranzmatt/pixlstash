"""Remove picture rows whose reference folder no longer exists.

When a reference folder is deleted PixlStash normally removes the associated
picture rows too.  If folders were removed by an older version or directly from
the database those rows can be left behind with a reference_folder_id that
points to a non-existent folder.  This script finds and removes them.

Usage:
    python scripts/cleanup_orphaned_reference_pictures.py [path/to/vault.db]

The default db path is vault.db in the current working directory.
