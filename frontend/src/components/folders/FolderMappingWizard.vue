/**
 * v1.11 Phase 3 - "Add a library", start to finish, in one dialog: point at
 * a folder, hear what it is, and for a folder of pictures with no library
 * yet, read it (Phase 2), name what its levels are, review, and only then
 * build the library.
 *
 * **Nothing exists until "Yes, build this library".** The read runs against a
 * plain folder while some other library is active, so Cancel or the header
 * close anywhere before that point cancels the read, clears any saved entry
 * and creates nothing - the outcome people expect from *Cancel*. "Organise
 * later" is a different offer: it builds the library and indexes everything,
 * leaving only the folder mapping for another day.
 *
 * Building is three things in a row: `addLibrary`, then a `useFolderMappingStore`
 * entry with `autoCommit: true` and the accepted assignments, then the same
 * switch-and-reload `LibrariesSection.switchTo()` uses. The switch reloads the
 * page, and the saved entry (it is `localStorage` backed) is what brings this
 * wizard back on the other side: `SideBar` auto-opens it with `resume` set,
 * straight into the Preview step, which commits on mount. The entry is
 * re-saved without `autoCommit` as soon as that commit has started, so a
 * deferred or interrupted commit resumes through the sidebar's "Finish
 * organising…" row at the scan card, as any saved read does, and never
 * commits twice. Only a completed commit clears the entry.
 *
 * The dialog itself never changes shape between the verdict and the scan:
 * both are drawn in `FolderMappingCard` under the same path field, and the
 * width is one number for every step.
