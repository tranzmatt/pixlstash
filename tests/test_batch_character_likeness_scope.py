"""Object-scope (BOLA) tests for ``POST /pictures/character_likeness/batch``.

This endpoint returns per-picture data (existence/`ready`/`eligible` signals and
the `character_likeness` score). Per CLAUDE.md §16.1 it must enforce object scope
before returning any resource-derived data, exactly like its single-id sibling
``GET /pictures/{id}/character_likeness`` (which calls ``enforce_picture_scope``).

The fix filters the client-supplied ``picture_ids`` through
``fetch_scope_allowed_picture_ids`` before any DB read: ids outside a scoped
token's grant are dropped from the work set and fall through to the deny path,
so they are indistinguishable from a missing/deleted id (no existence or score
leak). Owner/unscoped tokens (``token_scope is None``) keep full access.

These tests assert both directions:
- out-of-scope ids are denied (and indistinguishable from missing ids) under a
  scoped token;
- in-scope ids are still processed (over-blocking would be its own regression);
- the unscoped/owner path is unaffected;
- the endpoint stays OUT of READ_SAFE_POST_PATHS, so a READ resource token is
  blocked at the middleware before it can reach the handler at all.
