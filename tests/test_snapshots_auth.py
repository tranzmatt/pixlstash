"""HTTP-layer auth tests for the snapshot routes.

Snapshot routes are owner-only, and two independent layers must hold:

* ``require_unscoped_owner`` (the route dependency) rejects READ-scoped tokens,
  which do reach the route.
* The auth middleware fail-closed-rejects a forged ``ALL``+``resource_type``
  token *before* the route runs. ``create_token`` refuses to mint that shape,
  but a malicious / legacy / snapshot-restored row could still carry it, and it
  would otherwise leave ``token_scope is None`` and read as a full owner - the
  F1/F3 footgun.

A regression in either layer would pass every other test in the suite while
silently exposing the whole vault to share tokens - this file is the dedicated
regression guard.

    This is the malicious case, deliberately. ``create_token`` now *refuses* to

    ``auth.create_token``), so we cannot get one through the API. But the ban at
    the mint is not the only line of defense we care about: a token row carrying
    ``scope="ALL"`` + a ``resource_type`` could still arrive via a hand-crafted
    insert by an attacker with DB access, a token minted before the ban shipped,
    or a snapshot restore of an old row. Such a token is the F1/F3 footgun - the
    middleware only builds ``request.state.token_scope`` for non-``ALL`` scopes,
    so it would leave ``token_scope is None`` and be treated as a *full owner*
    while wearing a "restricted" label.

    So we bypass the API on purpose and forge the row directly, exactly as an
    attacker (or a legacy/snapshot path) would have to, then assert the auth
    middleware rejects it fail-closed before the route ever runs. The row mirrors
    ``create_token``'s construction (``token_hash`` + ``token_prefix``) so
