#
# A locked picture set is a hard freeze of its members' label/curation data. The
# recurring failure mode (CSO audit) is a NEW mutation path reaching a picture
# with no lock guard. A handler-list test only catches what its author remembered
# to list; this test is SINK-BASED instead: it enumerates every place the code
# writes label/curation data - Tag rows, the human-label ledger, the soft-delete
# flip, and a picture's description/score - and asserts the ENCLOSING function
# either carries a lock-guard token OR is on an explicit, justified exempt list.
# A guardrail that lists what you remembered cannot catch what you forgot; this
# one fails the moment an unguarded sink appears in a non-exempt function.

# Guardrail 8: Every mounted route is inventoried (authz-declaration scaffolding)
#
# Phase 0 of the backend authorization refactor (see the backend refactor plan
# §3.4/§6 and docs/backend_architecture.md §16.2). This is the safety net Phase 1
# builds on: it enumerates every ``(method, path_template)`` HTTP endpoint the
# built app actually exposes - the ground truth for the coverage matrix - and
# checks it against a declaration set. Today the declaration set is EMPTY (the
# ``authz`` registry does not exist yet), so this runs in AUDIT MODE with the
# full current-route allowlist below: it denies nothing and enforces no access
# policy - it only observes the route inventory. In Phase 1 the registry becomes
# the declaration set and entries burn down out of this allowlist as each route
# is declared, exactly like the direct-DB-call allowlist above.
#
# The enumeration uses pixlstash.route_inventory, which flattens FastAPI's lazy
# router inclusion via the framework's own resolver. Two fail-loud tests below
# guarantee the enumeration cannot silently under-count (which would fake
# "complete coverage") if a FastAPI upgrade changes the internal route model.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The audit-mode allowlist of routes not yet declared in the authz registry.
# Phase 1 Step 2 back-filled ALL mounted routes into ``ROUTE_POLICIES``
# (pixlstash/authz/registry.py), so this set has burned down to EMPTY: the
# registry is now the sole coverage matrix. A newly added data route must be
# declared in the registry (no longer parked here); the two assertions below then
# keep the matrix arithmetic - an undeclared route can't merge, and a stale
# allowlist entry can't rot. Do NOT re-populate this to silence a new route:
# declare it in the registry instead.

    the same question under a different name is a hole that no coverage matrix
    cell records, because the matrix records a route's *policy*, not the
    parameters it accepts (§16.6). This makes that second axis arithmetic.

    One-directional on purpose: declaring a name no route takes is harmless
    (``project_ids`` is declared ahead of a route using it), while a route taking
    an undeclared name is the bug.

    **What "machine-checked" does NOT mean here.** This walks *declared* query
    parameters and matches their *wire* names. Three shapes defeat it, and the
    third also weakens the anti-vacuity assertion below:

    1. **A wire name that does not say "project".** ``project_id: str =
       Query(None, alias="proj")`` is enumerated as ``proj``, which this regex does
       not match - and the gate is defeated by the same fact, because it matches
       ``request.query_params`` against ``PROJECT_FILTER_QUERY_PARAMS`` and the
       wire name really is ``proj``. Guardrail and gate fail together, which is
       precisely the case where a guardrail is worth nothing.
    2. **An undeclared parameter read straight off the request.** A handler doing
       ``request.query_params.get("owning_project")`` declares nothing, so it is
       invisible to this enumeration. Not hypothetical: ``routes/pictures/
       _misc.py`` and ``routes/pictures/_listing.py`` already read ``project_id``
       directly off ``request.query_params``, so the pattern is in-tree and
       available to copy. (Those two are covered *by the gate*, which reads the
       raw query string - but only because they kept the declared spelling.)
    3. **The nested-``Depends`` capability is not what the anti-vacuity assertion
       protects.** ``iter_api_query_params`` flattens the dependency tree so a
       parameter contributed one level down is enumerated, and §16.6 advertises
       that. But the assertion only requires ``project_id`` to be found *somewhere*,
       and ``project_id`` is taken at top level by a dozen routes: stub
       ``flatten_dependant_fields`` to a no-op and the assertion still passes while every
       nested parameter silently vanishes. No route today contributes a
       project-ish parameter *only* via a nested ``Depends``, so the capability is
       covered synthetically by
       ``test_query_parameter_enumeration_descends_nested_depends`` instead. That
       keeps the flattening honest; it does not make *this* test notice a real
       nested parameter disappearing, so do not assume it would.

    """The project-filter gate's boundary is acknowledged, not assumed (§16.6).

    ``enforce_project_filter_scope`` reads the query string only. A project named
    in a JSON body or form field is invisible to it, and the only thing keeping
    those routes safe today is that they are writes a READ-scoped token cannot
    reach. This is an acknowledgment inventory in the spirit of
    ``_KNOWN_WEBSOCKET_ROUTES``: it gates nothing, it just makes a new one
    impossible to add without someone looking at it.

    **Read the scope of each assertion; they are deliberately different.**

    1. Exact equality on **typed** bodies only (:data:`_PROJECT_REFS_IN_TYPED_BODY`).
       ``_iter_body_project_refs`` reads declared annotations, so this half is
       arithmetic over routes whose body has a declared shape, and nothing more.
       A body declared ``payload: dict = Body(...)`` declares no keys and
       contributes nothing - see assertion 3.
    2. **READ-reachability, over typed *and* known-opaque project routes.** This is
       the assertion that carries the actual safety argument: the paths yielded by
       the inventory are the same ``/api/v1/…`` strings ``READ_SAFE_POST_PATHS``
       holds and ``auth.py`` compares ``request.url.path`` against, so a project
       body field becoming READ-reachable fails here.
    3. Every route with an **opaque** body that a READ token can reach is on a
       hand-vetted list. Nothing can enumerate a ``dict`` body's keys, so this does
       not claim to know what those handlers read; it claims only that the set of
       routes where the blind spot is *live* stays small and looked-at. Today it is
       one route.

    What none of this covers: which opaque-bodied WRITE routes take a project.
    :data:`_PROJECT_REFS_IN_OPAQUE_BODY` names the five found by reading the

# SQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT_S}`` and the ``connect`` listener that sets the PRAGMAs
# and registers the custom SQL functions. A call site that builds its own
# engine gets neither and silently runs on SQLite's defaults: a 5 s busy
# timeout, a 2 MiB page cache, a rollback journal and foreign keys OFF. That
# has been a real bug twice (#651, #709).
#
# This is AST-based and recursive on purpose. The first version of this
# guardrail was a non-recursive text grep over one package directory, and every
# one of the shapes in _ENGINE_GUARDRAIL_ESCAPES walked straight past it.

# SQLAlchemy / SQLModel entry points that construct an Engine.
