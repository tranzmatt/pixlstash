"""Step 3 of the centralised-authz refactor: the gate goes ENFORCING for the
non-id-resolution policy classes (``OWNER_ONLY`` / ``LOCAL_OWNER_ONLY`` /
``PUBLIC``-consistency).

This is the first step that actually DENIES, so every assertion here is
both-directional per CLAUDE.md / §16.1: an out-of-scope principal is 403'd AND an
in-scope principal still reaches the route (over-blocking - especially of the
demo's share tokens - is its own regression).

Toggle mechanism (principal ruling 2026-07-21): the shipped constant
``AUTHZ_GATE_ENFORCING`` stays ``False`` (report-only) through Step 5; the
owner-class enforcement *code* lands now and is proven by flipping the gate to
``enforcing=True`` in these tests. Per-policy-class staging is carried by which
branches are implemented - ``*_SCOPED`` / ``SCOPED_LIST`` / ``body_ids`` batch are
pass-through until Step 4, asserted below. Because the shipped default stays
report-only, none of this changes runtime behaviour until the Step-6 flip; the
inline handler checks remain the live enforcement in the meantime.

Named regressions required by the plan:
* §16.3 host-capability retarget (``owner_only`` -> ``local_owner_only``): a remote
  owner COOKIE session is newly constrained vs a loopback one.
* N2: reviews / tag_health flip - an unscoped-READ token (which the looser inline
  ``fetch_scope_allowed`` gate admits) is newly 403'd by ``OWNER_ONLY``.
* F-c rider: ``GET /users/me/auth`` tightened ``any_token`` -> ``owner_only``.
