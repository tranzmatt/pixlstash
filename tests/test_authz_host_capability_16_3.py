"""§16.3 host-capability access design (principal ruling 2026-07-21).

Covers the three-lens (CSO/Principal/CEO) decided design landing before Step 5:

* ``LOCAL_OWNER_ONLY`` (the filesystem/folder routes, the library switch, and the
  host-path disclosures; the tier-split test's own name carries the count, and
  it is the only place that does - prose here goes stale, an assertion cannot)
  - loopback / RFC1918 LAN /
  **Tailscale CGNAT ``100.64.0.0/10``** all count as local; a genuinely remote
  owner is 403'd with a message NAMING ``allow_remote_host_ops`` unless that
  dedicated flag is set, which then admits the remote owner.
* ``LOOPBACK_OWNER_ONLY`` (the host-shell red-line routes) - strictly loopback; the
  ``allow_remote_host_ops`` flag can NEVER loosen them (RFC1918 + flag-on is still
  403).
* Reverse-proxy: with ``trusted_proxies`` set the owner's real (spoofed) client IP
  drives the gate - a public real client is 403'd (flag off), a LAN real client
  is allowed.

Both-directional per CLAUDE.md / §16.1: every deny is paired with an in-scope
allow so over-blocking is caught as its own regression. These tests set
``enforcing`` explicitly rather than relying on the shipped default, which was
``False`` when this file was written and is ``True`` today - one test
deliberately turns it **off**, to prove the middleware's
``READ_BLOCKED_GET_PATHS`` still refuses a share token if the documented
one-line rollback is ever taken.

# 2026-07-21 until #933 came to add a real one. server-config/open was a
# byte-identical sibling that shipped owner_only with no locality check (CSO
# Condition 1) and is reclassified here; the model shelf's `Open in file manager`
# (#933) is the fourth spawn and the first to reach it through the shared
# pixlstash/utils/host_open.py, which reads the opener's exit status where the
# three inline copies discard it. Export-to-folder (#291) is the fifth spawn and

    the e2e test hook; the filesystem/folder routes stay LOCAL_OWNER_ONLY. 54
    routes carry a locality tier = 47 local + 7 loopback.

    History, so a future change to this number arrives with its reason: 16 = 13 +
    3 originally; 17 = 13 + 4 after CSO Condition 1 folded in
    ``server-config/open``; 18 = 13 + 5 when the e2e test hook was declared; 19 =
    14 + 5 from 2026-08-01, when ``POST /libraries/active`` joined the local tier.
    That one is **not** a filesystem route and does not take a host path: it
    is local-only because switching library is the pivot that would otherwise let
    one stolen owner token reach every registered library, and because it resets
    every connected client (plan §11 q4). 23 = 18 + 5 from 2026-08-09, when the
    model shelf's four ``model-folders`` mutators joined the local tier (shelf
    plan B5): three take a caller-supplied host path and the fourth walks one,
    which is the reference-folder class exactly. The shelf's *read* routes stay
    ``owner_only`` - they surface host paths but take none.

    26 = 21 + 5 from later the same day, when the shelf's **move** block (B7)
    joined it: ``POST``, ``GET`` and ``DELETE /model-moves``. The POST is
    settled by precedent - it writes files into one registered folder and
    unlinks them from another, which is strictly more than
    ``reference-folders/{id}/move-pictures``, already on this tier. The GET is
    the deliberate one: it is not a shelf read but the *control surface* of a
    host-filesystem operation - how a move is watched, beside the DELETE that
    stops one - so the tier that alone may start a move is the tier that may
    observe and steer it. **Not** a secrecy claim about the relpaths: a remote
    owner is 200 on ``GET /adapters``, which serves ``locations[].folder_path``
    and ``locations[].relpath`` for every copy (the earlier wording here said
    otherwise and was corrected in the B7 sign-off). The DELETE is the POST's
    authority from the other end.

    28 = 23 + 5 later still, when the shelf's **ai-toolkit import** block joined
    it: ``GET /model-folders/{folder_id}/runs`` and ``POST /model-imports``.
    The listing walks a registered output root, which is ``rescan``'s authority;
    the import writes into one registered folder and may unlink from the output
    root, which is ``POST /model-moves``' authority. Neither takes a host path -
    the import names a registered folder id and a run *name* - so they are on
    this tier for what they do, not for what they accept.

    29 = 24 + 5 with ``POST /model-folders/{folder_id}/relocate``, which moves
    every file the managed model store holds to a caller-supplied host path and
    unlinks the originals. It is the ``reference-folders/{folder_id}/relocate``
    class carrying ``POST /model-moves``' file movement, so it is the one route
    in the shelf that is on this tier for **both** reasons at once.

    30 = 25 + 5 with ``GET /model-folders/{folder_id}/runs/{run_name}/samples/
    {filename}``, which serves one preview image out of a registered output root
    so a step can be judged before it is imported: it reads inside a registered
    host root and writes nothing, which is ``rescan``'s authority class.

    31 = 26 + 5 with ``POST /model-files``, the shelf's ``Add file`` (plan F6).
    It is the second route on this tier for **both** reasons at once, and the
    first shelf route that takes a host path in its *body*: it copies one loose
    file from anywhere on the machine into a registered folder and registers it.
    The path cannot be avoided - the file is by definition somewhere nobody
    registered - so the containment is on the write and the read is bounded
    instead (one regular ``.safetensors``, refused outright if it already lies
    inside a registered folder). It never unlinks: the source is the owner's own
    file.

    32 = 27 + 5 with ``GET /taggers/plugin-diagnostics`` (#326). It is the
    first route on this tier for **disclosure alone**: it takes no path, walks
    nothing and writes nothing. It returns two things and both name paths on
    the host - the folder the tagger registry scans, which is under the owner's
    home directory, and the import failures of the plugins in it, whose message
    is ``str(exc)`` from third-party code and so carries whatever path that code
    was reaching for. Both were fields on ``GET /taggers``, which was ANY_TOKEN,
    so every share-link holder was reading them. Splitting them out costs a
    remote owner nothing real: acting on either means editing a file in that
    folder and restarting. (``GET /taggers`` itself went ``any_token`` ->
    ``owner_only`` in the same change, which is not a locality tier and so does
    not move this arithmetic.)

    33 = 28 + 5 with ``GET /adapters/{sha256}/file``, which streams one
    registered adapter's bytes so a generator on another machine can use what
    this one catalogues - the locations the detail route serves are *this*
    host's paths and mean nothing over there. It is the **first shelf read off
    the ``owner_only`` tier**, and the line that kept the others on it says why:
    they "surface host paths but take none". This one takes none either, but it
    does not surface a path - it returns the raw bytes of a file inside a
    registered model folder, which is the ``.../runs/{run_name}/samples/
    {filename}`` authority class exactly: reads inside a registered host root,
    writes nothing, and is a new capability rather than a narrower view of the
    metadata route beside it. Loopback/LAN/Tailscale is the deployment the route
    exists for, so the tier costs it nothing; a genuinely remote generator needs
    ``allow_remote_host_ops``, which is the safe direction to fail in.

    34 = 29 + 5 with ``POST /model-files/delete``, the shelf's delete verb
    (#933). It is the **unlink half of ``POST /model-moves`` standing alone**:
    it removes the owner's model files - to the OS trash by default, permanently
    on request - and then drops their hub rows. It takes no host path, and the
    same containment the mover uses for its source decides every path it
    touches; what puts it here is the destruction itself, which is the strongest
    thing the shelf does to a disk and is not made weaker by the ids being ours
    rather than the caller's.

    35 = 29 + 6 with ``POST /models/{model_id}/open-location``, the shelf's
    ``Open in file manager`` (#933) and the **first addition to the loopback
    tier since the e2e test hook**. It is the same host-GUI spawn as the three
    file-manager routes before it - ``server/restart``, the fourth member, drives
    the host shell without spawning a GUI - reached through the shared
    ``pixlstash/utils/host_open.py`` rather than inline, so it needs no new
    argument for the tier: the authority is the host's own shell. It is here for
    the *spawn* and not for an input - there is no body, the id is a hub
    ``model.id``, and the path is the scanner's own folder joined to its relpath
    and contained, exactly as ``GET /adapters/{sha256}/file`` contains the same
    join. The local count is unchanged.

    37 = 31 + 6 with the two ``GET /models/{model_id}/samples`` routes, which
    read a training run's previews back off the shelf after the import copied
    them into ``<stem>_samples/`` beside the checkpoint. The byte route is
    ``GET /adapters/{sha256}/file`` again - raw bytes out of a registered model
    folder - and the listing walks one directory inside that folder, reporting
    names of files PixlStash never registered, which is ``rescan``'s authority
    narrowed to a directory. **The plan for that change asked for
    ``owner_only``**, on the grounds that both are addressed by a ``model.id``
    with no host path crossing the wire; that is the argument the
    ``/adapters/{sha256}/file`` entry above records as *not* the argument, since
    the tier follows the authority exercised rather than what the route accepts.
    The listing is kept beside the byte route rather than one tier below it, so
    a caller who may not fetch a preview is not handed a list of them. The
    loopback count is unchanged: both are reads, and neither spawns anything.

    41 = 35 + 6 with the four v1.11 library-lifecycle routes, and they land on
    this tier for three different reasons rather than one. ``GET
    /libraries/inspect`` and ``POST /libraries`` are the plain path-authority
    case: both take a caller-supplied host path through the same
    ``validate_reference_folder_path`` chokepoint as the folder picker, the
    first walking it to say what the folder is and the second writing a vault
    into it and restricting it to the owner. Neither creates a directory -
    ``POST /filesystem/folders``, already on this tier, is what the picker's
    ``New folder`` uses - so the authority stays bounded to the one folder the
    owner named. ``DELETE /libraries/{library_uuid}`` is the ``POST
    /libraries/active`` argument again and **not** the path one: it takes a
    registry uuid, removes no file, and is here because every share link
    pointing at that library stops working, which is authority over other
    principals' state. ``PATCH /libraries/{library_uuid}`` is the weakest of the
    four and is here by consistency rather than capability - it writes one hub
    column and renames nothing on disk - because the Settings pane gates its
    whole management menu on one ``can_manage`` locality answer, and splitting
    the rename onto a looser tier would give that pane two rules to explain
    while buying a remote owner nothing they could act on. The loopback count is
    unchanged: none of the four spawns anything.

    43 = 37 + 6 with the two ``/server-config/views`` routes, PixlStash Views
    (v1.11 Phase 7): the library's sets, people and projects published as folders
    of **links** to the files the owner already keeps. The PATCH takes a
    caller-supplied host path and writes a folder tree into it, which is the
    ``POST /model-folders`` class for what it accepts and the ``POST
    /model-moves`` class for the filesystem it drives - so it is the third route
    here for both reasons at once. It is on this tier for the authority and not
    for the destruction: it creates only links, and the one thing it unlinks is
    a name that is not the last one - a symlink, or a regular file with
    ``st_nlink > 1``. ``shutil.rmtree`` is deliberately not used, because it is
    not link-aware and would delete a file the owner had dropped into a view
    folder; anything that is not a link is reported back as ``kept_by_owner``
    and left standing. A folder that already holds content and carries no
    ``.pixlstash-views`` marker is refused rather than adopted, so a views root
    aimed at a folder of real pictures never becomes one. The GET is the control surface argument that put ``GET
    /model-moves`` here rather than one tier down: it names the host folder the
    tree went to, and the tier that alone may publish it is the tier that may see
    where it landed. It is also on ``READ_BLOCKED_GET_PATHS``, so the documented
    ``AUTHZ_GATE_ENFORCING = False`` rollback does not hand that path back to
    every share token. The loopback count is unchanged: neither route spawns
    anything.

    46 = 40 + 6 with the folder-structure read's three routes (v1.11 Phase 2):
    ``POST``, ``GET .../status`` and ``DELETE /folder-structure/read``. The POST
    is ``GET /filesystem/browse``'s class and then some - it takes a
    caller-supplied host path, walks it *recursively* and decodes pictures out
    of it, where browse lists one directory - so it must not be a second,
    weaker way to ask what is on the disk. It is the ``GET /libraries/inspect``
    lesson above applied one route later, and then once more: the blocklist runs
    after ``realpath`` (validating the string the caller sent lets a symlink hand
    ``/etc`` to a route that walks it) **and again on every directory the walk
    descends into**, because a root-only check is a check on one string - ``/``
    names no restricted directory and contains all of them. Measured: 391 of 400
    folders came out of ``/etc``, ``/proc`` and ``/root`` before that second
    check, and 0 after. The GET is the deliberate
    one, for the reason ``GET /model-moves`` is on this tier: what it carries
    *is* the answer, a map of the owner's folder names, tree shape and picture
    counts, so polling cannot be a lower bar than starting. The DELETE is the
    POST's authority from the other end. None of the three writes anything -
    no row is created, no file is moved - which is why the tier follows the
    disclosure and the path, not a destructive verb. The loopback count is
    unchanged: nothing here spawns anything.

    48 = 46 + 2 with the folder-structure commit's two routes (v1.11 Phase 3):
    ``POST`` and ``GET .../commit/status``. The POST takes no fresh host path -
    it addresses a settled read by ``task_id`` - but it is the write that
    follows the read's own tier: it registers the read's root as a reference
    folder and creates the accepted projects/people/sets/tags from it, which is
    ``POST /reference-folders``' authority reached through a different door. The
    GET is the read status route's own argument again: what it carries is the
    commit's result, the same host-path-derived map the read already gates at
    this tier, so polling the write must not be a lower bar than polling the
    read was. Neither spawns anything, so the loopback count is unchanged.

    50 = 44 + 6 with the layout pair (v1.11 Phase 4b): ``GET`` and
    ``PATCH /server-config/layout``. Neither takes a host path at all - the root
    is the library's own - and the PATCH moves nothing, because the release's
    rule is that every path already in the library is true the moment it is
    written. What puts them here is the authority the PATCH *hands out*: from
    then on a background task renames the owner's files into the folder names it
    chose, so the tier that may decide that is the tier that holds it, and the
    GET is its control surface by the ``GET /model-moves`` argument. The GET is
    also on ``READ_BLOCKED_GET_PATHS``, so an ``AUTHZ_GATE_ENFORCING = False``
    rollback does not hand the shape of the owner's folder tree to share tokens.
    The move itself is NOT here: ``POST /pictures/layout/move-to-match`` is
    ``picture_scoped``, on the ``POST /pictures/rotate`` line, because the
    caller supplies pictures and never a path. The loopback count is unchanged:
    neither route spawns anything.

    51 = 44 + 7 with ``POST /pictures/export/folder`` (#291), export-to-folder:
    a local owner already has the destination mounted, so the ZIP-and-download
    round trip in ``POST /pictures/export`` is pure overhead, and this route
    writes the exported pictures straight into a caller-named destination
    instead. It takes a caller-supplied host path exactly like the filesystem
    picker's routes, which alone would be ``LOCAL_OWNER_ONLY`` - but once every
    picture is written it opens the destination in the host file manager
    through the shared ``pixlstash/utils/host_open.py``, the same spawn as
    ``pictures/{id}/open-location`` and the shelf's `Open in file manager`, and
    that is the stricter tier the write-then-open pair as a whole is on. The
    local count is unchanged: nothing else here moved.

    52 = 45 + 7 with ``DELETE /folder-structure/commit`` (``bd1ff8f7``), which
    is ``DELETE /folder-structure/read`` one route later: it stops the owner's
    in-flight commit - abort, or "organise later" - which is authority over
    another principal's operation and belongs on the tier that starts it. **It
    landed without this number being moved**, so the assertion below was red on
    ``develop`` until the entry after this one; recorded here rather than
    quietly folded in, because a counter that gets corrected without saying so
    is a counter nobody trusts next time.

    54 = 47 + 7 with the migration pair (v1.11 Phase 4c): ``GET`` and ``POST
    /server-config/layout/migration``, moving an existing library onto the
    layout the pair above chose. The POST is the strongest host-filesystem
    thing any route in this library does - it renames *every* picture in the
    library's own root - and it is above ``POST /pictures/layout/move-to-match``
    for the reason that route is ``picture_scoped``: there the caller names the
    pictures, so the scope check is the check that matters; here the caller
    names none and the scope is the whole library, so there is nothing for a
    per-object gate to bound and the tier has to carry it instead. It takes no
    host path - the root is the library's own, every destination is rendered
    from a layout only this tier could have set - and the Phase 4b planner's
    refusals still stand under it (a source outside the root, a symlink, a
    destination that would escape). The GET is the control-surface argument
    again, and this time for a second reason as well: what it returns is a
    count of the owner's files, sample paths and where a mount point sits
    inside their library, which is ``GET /folder-structure/read/status``'s
    disclosure class. It is on ``READ_BLOCKED_GET_PATHS`` beside ``GET
    /server-config/layout`` for the same rollback reason. The loopback count is
    unchanged: neither route spawns anything.

    """Derive the belt's membership instead of writing it down.

    ``READ_BLOCKED_GET_PATHS`` matches literal paths, so an owner-class GET is
    only protected under the documented ``AUTHZ_GATE_ENFORCING = False``
    rollback if its own path is in that frozenset. The rollback test beside this
    one names two paths; this one asserts the *rule*, so the next such GET fails
    the build rather than waiting for a review to notice it.

    **The rule covers the whole owner class, not just the locality tier
    (#1177 item 11).** It used to stop at ``LOCAL_OWNER_ONLY`` /
    ``LOOPBACK_OWNER_ONLY``, on the reading that those are the routes exercising
    host authority - and that is true of what they *do*, but the belt is about
    what a share token may *see* under the rollback. ``GET /insights`` returns
    the absolute path of the folder behind every finding and
    ``GET /moves/pending`` returns ``old_path``/``new_path`` for every file the
    owner moved outside PixlStash; both are ``OWNER_ONLY``, both were off the
    belt, and this derivation - the one thing that would have caught it - did
    not look at them. Widening it also removes the judgement call: an entry is
    owed by *tier*, not by someone grading the payload.

    The templated ones cannot be expressed in an exact-match frozenset at all.
    The locality-tier ones are pinned as a known set rather than ignored: adding
    a sixth fails here, and closing the gap needs prefix matching (the follow-up
    recorded in ``tests/test_model_shelf_api.py`` and
    ``docs/backend_architecture.md`` §16.3). The templated ``OWNER_ONLY`` GETs
    are deliberately *not* pinned - that tier grows with ordinary feature work,
    and a pin there would fail an unrelated route addition with a message about
    a belt it cannot join.

    **``GET /adapters/{sha256}/file`` joined that set on 2026-08-15, and it is
    the sharpest member of it.** The other two serve a run listing and a preview
    image; this one streams model weights. So under the documented
    ``AUTHZ_GATE_ENFORCING = False`` rollback a share token would not read a
    directory - it would download every adapter on the shelf. It is on the list
    rather than closed here because closing it means prefix matching in a belt
    every route passes through, which is its own change with its own review, and
    a bespoke ``startswith`` for one route is the kind of special case that rots.
    The gate refuses it today and
    ``tests/test_model_shelf_api.py::test_no_share_token_can_download_a_model_file``
    proves that by mutation; this note is about the rollback, not about today.
