    they were dropped (it is OWNER_ONLY now, for the third-party plugin text it
    still serves), the folders are host paths under the owner's home directory,
    and an error row carries the absolute ``file`` it failed on plus exception
    text from third-party code. Nothing in the UI ever read either - the failures are in
    the server log, where they were being read from anyway. The tagger
    equivalents are served instead by ``GET /taggers/plugin-diagnostics``,
    which is LOCAL_OWNER_ONLY, because the Auto-tagging screen does show them.
