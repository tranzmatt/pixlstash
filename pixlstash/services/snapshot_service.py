        an OS file handle on the VACUUM INTO *destination* alive on whichever
        connection issued the statement until that connection is closed.  The
        writer session's connection lives in the engine pool for the whole
        process lifetime, so issuing VACUUM INTO on it left the freshly-written
        snapshot file open indefinitely; Windows then refuses to delete it
        (``WinError 32``), which is why ``shutil.rmtree`` of the snapshots dir
        failed in CI.  POSIX allows unlinking an open file, so this only ever
        bit Windows.  A dedicated connection releases the handle immediately on
        ``close()``.
