"""The human-label ledger - one place that records human POS/NEG decisions.

Absence of a ``Tag`` row is overloaded: it means both "a human reviewed this and said
NO" and "nobody has looked." That ambiguity wrecks training for any tag whose negatives
are scarce (every new tag), because absence read as a negative teaches "this tag is
always absent." This module fixes it at the source: every human accept/reject on a
``(picture, tag)`` is recorded on the :class:`TagPrediction` row as an explicit
``label_state`` (POS/NEG) with ``label_source='human'`` - a real supervision signal that
survives tag edits, tagger re-runs, and scans.

Route every human decision through :func:`record_human_label` (or
:func:`record_human_label_if_relevant` for generic tag edits) so accept and reject are
provably symmetric and the hardest data - a human-reviewed negative - is never dropped.
Use :func:`not_human_labeled` as the single guard predicate so model/scan writes never
clobber a human label.
