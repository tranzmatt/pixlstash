"""Person-tag taxonomy and the keyword classifier for impossible-tag review.

A picture with no detectable face that still carries person-tags ("brown hair",
"face", "nose") is a suspect. But no-face is only a prior, not a verdict: a hand, a
shoulder, a back-of-head are people with no visible face. So the *description*
decides, and the strip is category-aware:

  * Face-requiring tags (face, nose, lips, eyes…) literally need a face, so they are
    wrong on *any* no-face picture and are stripped regardless of the description.
  * The broader person/body tags (hair, hand, shoulder…) are stripped only when the
    description confirms a true non-person object ("wooden wardrobe", "motorcycle").

The vocabulary here is a STARTER set, deliberately conservative - clothing and
accessory tags are excluded, because a product photo of a dress legitimately carries
"dress" with no person in frame. Refine ``PERSON_TAGS`` from real co-occurrence on
no-face pictures with ``scripts/report_impossible_tags.py`` before trusting the
auto-strip tiers. The classifier is keyword-first by design (deterministic, auditable);
an optional LLM judge can replace :func:`classify_description` for the ambiguous bucket
later without changing this interface.
