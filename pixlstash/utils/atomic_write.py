"""Atomic file-write helpers.

Writing config via ``open(path, "w")`` truncates the file at open, so a crash
or power loss mid-write leaves a zero-length or half-written file.  For
``server-config.json`` that is fatal: the server cannot parse it on the next
boot.  These helpers stage the new content in a sibling temp file, fsync it,
then ``os.replace`` it over the target (an atomic rename on POSIX and Windows),
and fsync the parent directory so the rename itself survives a crash - matching
the durability the restore subsystem already uses for the DB swap.
