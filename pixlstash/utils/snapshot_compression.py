"""Whole-file zstd compression for vault snapshot archives.

Snapshots are full SQLite copies of the vault DB. To keep the expensive,
GPU-regenerated blobs (CLIP image/text embeddings, InsightFace face
features) inside the snapshot *without* the on-disk cost, the ``.sqlite``
file is compressed with zstd at rest and decompressed to a temp file only
when it is actually read (restore / preview).

SQLite cannot query a compressed file in place - its pager needs random,
seekable page access - so a snapshot is treated as an archive: compress on
creation, decompress to a scratch ``.sqlite`` before any DB work. This module
is the single place that knows the on-disk format.

Streaming (chunked) compress/decompress is used so a multi-GB snapshot never
has to be held in memory.
