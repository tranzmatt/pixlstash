"""Utilities for reading, writing, and detecting sidecar caption files.

A sidecar file sits next to an image and carries either comma-separated **tags**
(training-data convention) or a free-form **description**.  Unlike the original
single-file scheme, PixlStash now treats tags and descriptions as two
independent sidecars, each with its own filename *suffix* applied to the image
stem:

    image.png  ->  image_tags.txt          (tags,        suffix "_tags.txt")
    image.png  ->  image_description.txt    (description, suffix "_description.txt")

Suffixes are configurable per reference folder.  When a folder has no explicit
suffix configured, known conventions are probed and each candidate file is
classified by its name (and, for an ambiguous bare ``.txt``, by its content).
