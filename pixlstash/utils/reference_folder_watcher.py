"""Filesystem watcher for reference folders.

Uses watchdog to monitor reference folder directories for new, changed, or
deleted image files and sidecar caption files.  When a relevant change is
detected the owning folder's ``last_scanned`` timestamp is reset to zero so
the :class:`~pixlstash.tasks.reference_folder_scan_finder.ReferenceFolderScanFinder`
schedules an immediate rescan, and the work-planner is woken so the scan task
runs without waiting for the normal 5-minute poll interval.

Events are debounced per folder so that rapid sequences (e.g. an editor doing
an atomic write via temp-file → rename) are collapsed into a single rescan.
