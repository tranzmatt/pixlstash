"""Plugin template - copy this file to your user plugin directory to get started.

Licensing note:
This template and the plugin API base class are MIT-licensed so external/user
plugins can be authored under any license.

This file is excluded from plugin discovery and will never be loaded as-is.

Quick-start
-----------
1. Copy this file to your user plugin directory (PixlStash logs the path on startup).
2. Rename it (anything except ``plugin_template.py``).
3. Fill in your plugin name, display name, parameters, and ``run()`` logic.
4. Restart PixlStash Server - your plugin will appear in the Filters menu.

User plugin directories
