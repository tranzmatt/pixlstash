"""Refresh face embeddings in place when the InsightFace model pack changes.

When a user switches ``insightface_model_pack`` (e.g. ``buffalo_l`` → ``auraface``)
the existing :class:`~pixlstash.db_models.face.Face` rows still hold embeddings
from the old pack. The detector (SCRFD-10G) is the **same** in both supported
packs, so the detections are essentially identical and only the recognition
embedding changes.

This task therefore refreshes ``features`` + ``model_pack`` **in place** on the
existing rows, preserving each row's ``character_id`` (the manual identity
assignment) and the row identity. It does NOT delete-and-reinsert as the default
path, because that would wipe manual character assignments.

Matching strategy (per picture):

1. Match new detections to existing rows by ``(frame_index, face_index)`` - the
   extractor assigns ``face_index`` deterministically by sorted bbox position, so
   with an identical detector the indices line up.
2. Any remaining unmatched pairs are matched by bbox IoU (handles a rare ordering
   or count delta between runs).
3. Genuinely new detections are inserted; existing rows with no match are removed
   (logged), respecting ``UniqueConstraint(picture_id, frame_index, face_index)``.
