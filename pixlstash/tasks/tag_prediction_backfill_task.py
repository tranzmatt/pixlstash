    """Generate TagPrediction rows for pictures that have tags but no predictions.

    Pictures tagged before inline prediction-writing existed (or by a different
    engine at the time) keep their confirmed ``Tag`` rows but have zero
    ``tag_prediction`` rows, and the normal pipeline never revisits them
    (``MissingTagFinder`` only re-tags pictures carrying a retag sentinel). This
    task runs the PixlStash tagger purely to recover the raw confidence scores,
    then writes predictions from those scores against the picture's *existing*
    applied tags. It never adds, removes, or rewrites a ``Tag`` row, so a
    curated tag set is left untouched.

    Scoped to the PixlStash tagger: only it produces the raw per-label sigmoid
    scores predictions are built from. The finder gates on that, but the task
    re-checks defensively.

    Note: this uses the full-image scoring pass only. The live ``TagTask`` also
    boosts a small whitelist of quality tags via face-crop inference; that
    refinement is intentionally omitted here to keep the backfill a single
    inference pass. Every applied tag still gets a prediction row (at worst with
    ``confidence=0.0``), so the review UI has a row for every tag.
