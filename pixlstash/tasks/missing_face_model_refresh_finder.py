"""Finder that selects pictures whose faces were produced by a different pack.

When ``insightface_model_pack`` changes, existing :class:`Face` rows still carry
embeddings from the previous pack. This finder selects pictures that have at
least one face whose ``model_pack`` differs from the currently configured pack
and schedules a :class:`FaceModelRefreshTask` to refresh those embeddings IN
PLACE (preserving ``character_id``).

It declares ``depends_on=[FACE_EXTRACTION]`` so the refresh sweep yields to
initial face extraction: brand-new pictures (which have no faces yet) are always
processed first and never starved by a refresh.
