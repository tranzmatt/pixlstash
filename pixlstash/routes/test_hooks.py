"""E2E-only test hooks for the WebSocket grid-event system.

This router exists **solely** to let Playwright deterministically inject a
WebSocket grid event by driving ``vault.notify`` with a controlled payload.
The e2e backend boots with ``disable_background_workers: true``, so the
tag/quality/smart-score/face events behind most "continuous refresh" and
"pill-on-own-change" reports never fire on their own. This endpoint reproduces
those flood / echo scenarios on demand, without real-timing nondeterminism.

Security posture (do not weaken):

* **Off by default, off in production.** The router is registered **only** when
  the server config flag ``enable_test_hooks`` is true (default ``False``).
  When the flag is false the route does not exist at all (404), not merely 403.
  Production never sets the flag; only ``frontend/e2e/serve_e2e_backend.py``
  does, for the hermetic test backend.
* **Owner-only, defense in depth.** Even when the flag is on, the handler calls
  ``auth.require_unscoped_owner`` - a full cookie session or an unscoped
  ALL-token. READ tokens and resource-scoped tokens are rejected (the auth
  middleware already blocks READ-token writes; the handler re-checks). The
  endpoint emits broadcast events but never reads or returns per-object
  resource data, so it requires no ``enforce_picture_scope`` chokepoint:
  scoped tokens can never reach it.

See ``docs/reviews/2026-06-grid-refresh-cleanup-plan.md`` §4 Phase 2 and
§6 decision 1.
