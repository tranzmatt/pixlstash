"""Normalize existing stack positions to a contiguous 0-based ordering.

The grid's stack-leader filter selects the leader purely in SQL with
``deleted = 0 AND (stack_id IS NULL OR stack_position = 0)`` (see migration
0047 and ``Picture.find``). That is only correct if every stack has a
*non-deleted* member at ``stack_position = 0``.

Historically several write paths could leave a stack without a position-0
member: ``assign_picture_to_stack`` appended at ``max(position) + 1`` (and left
NULL positions untouched), and soft-deleting the leader left a deleted picture
sitting at position 0. Such stacks silently disappear from the grid.

The write paths are now fixed to call ``stacking.normalize_stack_positions``,
but existing rows still need a one-time correction. This migration renumbers
each stack's members to contiguous 0-based positions using the same ordering as
``normalize_stack_positions``: non-deleted members first, then by explicit
position (NULLs last), then by id. It is pure data normalization (no schema
change) and is idempotent.
