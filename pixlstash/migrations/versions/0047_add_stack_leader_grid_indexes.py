"""Add partial composite indexes for stack-leader grid queries.

The standard grid endpoint always adds a stack_leaders_only filter:
  WHERE deleted=0 AND import_excluded=0
    AND (stack_id IS NULL OR stack_position = 0)

The existing ix_picture_grid_* composite indexes cover (deleted, import_excluded,
sort_key, id) but do NOT include the stack-leader condition.  SQLite therefore
scans every qualifying non-deleted/non-excluded row and filters out non-leaders
at read time, which on large libraries means reading many more rows than needed
for each paginated page.

These new partial indexes embed the stack-leader condition in the index itself so
that SQLite only visits rows that would pass all three filters, eliminating the
extra scan work.
