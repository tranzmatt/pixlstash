"""Reset picture.metadata_hash so it is recomputed with membership folded in.

``database._compute_picture_metadata_hash`` now also covers picture-set and
project membership, so a picture moved between sets/projects is correctly
detected as changed by the restore preview and snapshot identical-state
detection. Existing hashes were computed with the previous algorithm (columns +
tags + faces only); reset them to NULL so they are recomputed with the current
algorithm. The hash is repopulated lazily - by the ``after_flush`` hook on the
next write and by ``RestoreService.compare_hashes`` on demand - so no
application logic belongs here. Data-only; no schema change.
