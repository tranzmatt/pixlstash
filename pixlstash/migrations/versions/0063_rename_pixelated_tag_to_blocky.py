"""Rename the anomaly tag "pixelated" to "blocky".

The anomaly tagger's quality label was renamed from ``pixelated`` to ``blocky`` (a clearer
name for blocky/compression-style degradation). Existing ``tag`` and ``tag_prediction``
rows still carry the old value, so this migration renames them in place - preserving any
human POS/NEG supervision attached to the prediction rows - and NULL-resets the smart score
of affected pictures so it recomputes under the tag's (changed) penalty weight.

Data-only: no schema changes. The rename is collision-safe against the (picture_id, tag)
unique constraint in case a database already produced fresh ``blocky`` rows from a newer
tagger before this migration ran; human-labelled rows win such a collision.
