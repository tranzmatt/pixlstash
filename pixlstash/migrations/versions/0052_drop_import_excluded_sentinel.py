"""Drop the import_excluded sentinel column and convert its rows to the ledger.

``Picture.import_excluded`` used to be a "permanent-delete sentinel": when a
user emptied the scrapheap and the source file lived in a reference folder with
``allow_delete_file=False``, the row was kept with ``import_excluded=True`` so
the reference-folder scan would not re-import the still-on-disk file.  That
coupled file-protection to row-visibility: those rows were filtered out of every
``Picture.find()`` query, so they vanished from the scrapheap grid while still
being counted by the badge (the "72 deleted, empty grid" bug).

File-protection is now decoupled from the DB row.  Every permanently deleted
scrapheap picture loses its row and gains a ``deleted_file_log`` entry, which is
what stops re-import.  This migration retires the now-vestigial column.

The data conversion below is a one-time, bounded migration of existing sentinel
rows into the ledger.  It is REQUIRED for correctness: without it, the on-disk
files behind the old sentinel rows would be re-imported on the next reference
folder scan (the new scan path skips files only via ``deleted_file_log``, not
via ``import_excluded``).  CLAUDE.md prefers schema-only migrations, but this
sentinel->ledger conversion is necessary for the column drop to be safe, so it
lives here rather than in application code.

Several composite/partial grid indexes (added in 0044 and 0047) list
``import_excluded`` as a column, and SQLite refuses to drop a column an index
references.  They are dropped first and recreated without ``import_excluded``
(the grid queries no longer filter on it), so grid sorts stay index-covered.
