"""Add composite indexes on picture to speed up grid sort queries.

The default grid sort is ORDER BY score DESC, id DESC with WHERE deleted=0
AND import_excluded=0.  Without a covering index SQLite performs a full table
scan + filesort for every grid load.  This migration adds three composite
indexes that let SQLite satisfy the WHERE clause and the ORDER BY from the
index alone for the three most common sort keys (score, created_at,
imported_at).
